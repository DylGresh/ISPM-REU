    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You'll need to create a HuggingFace account and access token:\n",
    "   1. Create an account on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co).\n",
    "   2. Once logged into your account, click your profile picture in the upper right corner and navigate to Settings > Access Tokens.\n",
    "   3. Click New Token and generate a new token, I made mine a \"Write\" token but it shouldn't matter if it's a \"Read\" or \"Write\" token for this script.\n",
    "2. Make sure your Python is version 3.9 or later with the `python --version` command.\n",
    "3. Packages you'll need to have installed:\n",
    "   1. huggingface_hub\n",
    "   2. jupyter\n",
    "   3. llama-cpp-python\n",
    "      - This package also requires a C compiler since it's Python bindings for C/C++ code.\n",
    "        - For Windows, use [Microsoft's Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).\n",
    "        - For Linux, use [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).\n",
    "        - For Mac, have [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) installed.\n",
    "4. Installing packages\n",
    "   1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:\n",
    "      1. `python -m venv .env`\n",
    "      2. Activate the environment:\n",
    "         1. Windows: `.env\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "         2. Linux/Max: `./.env/bin/activate`\n",
    "      3. If you were able to get a C compiler:\n",
    "         - `pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager --no-cache-dir huggingface_hub jupyter llama-cpp-python`\n",
    "      4. If you were unable to get a C compiler:\n",
    "         - `pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager --no-cache-dir huggingface_hub jupyter llama-cpp-python ----extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cpu`\n",
    "      - I've included the `--upgrade` and `--upgrade-strategy eager` flags just in case you're doing this in an already existing virtual environment or have tried unsuccessfully to install the packages before, this will cause pip to upgrade all the packages and dependencies if they're already installed, ensuring you're working with the latest stable versions of everything\n",
    "5. Setup git & git-lfs:\n",
    "   1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you don't already have it installed.\n",
    "      1. Setup your git account and verify that you're able to clone a private repo (doesn't matter if the repo actually has anything in it, just need to make sure that you're able to use git properly).\n",
    "   2. Follow the git-lfs install guide [git-lfs](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=installation_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs#installing).\n",
    "   3. If you didn't run it in the guide, run the command `git lfs install` after getting git setup and git-lfs installed.\n",
    "6. Setup huggingface-cli:\n",
    "   1. Copy your access token that you made in step 1 to your clipboard.\n",
    "   2. Run the command `huggingface-cli login` and paste your access token when prompted.\n",
    "   3. I said yes to add the token to my git credentials, I don't think this is necessary though.\n",
    "7. Continue!"
